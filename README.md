# Project Movies

Project 12 - Movies site by Christoffer Torninger and Rebecca Philipson

The goal of this project was to build a multi-page application using React Router. We learned how to pass information in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content and how to combine useState and UseEffect when using APIs.

## The problem

First we requested an API key and fetched all the information we needed from the API. Then we set up the routes in the app component and created the two components responsible for showing the movie list and the detailed info about each movie. We had some minor problems regarding error messages for the images but solved them by looking at Stack Overflow questions. We styled the page in accordance with the design that we got in the project brief.
